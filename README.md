### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have a huge passion for making sense of data. The larger the dataset, the brighter my eyes shine. I also love coding. Data science is where my two passions merge. 
  
- ðŸŒ± I have just completed Turing College Data Science program (Machine learning).
  
- âš¡ My entire career I have been working with business finances - this is my key domain knowledge.
  
- ðŸ‘¯ I love making sense of data and communicating the discoveries to decision makers.
  
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for a junior data scientist, intermediate or senior data analyst role. 

- ðŸ˜„ My hobbies:
  * Jogging
  * Coding
  * Reading
    
- ðŸ›  My tools:
  * Advanced Excel (Power Query) - 20 years / Power BI - 4 years
  * Python - hobby-styding since 2015. 2022-2023 was a rocket year in Turing College.
  * SQL
