### Hi there 👋

I have a huge passion for making sense of data. The larger the dataset, the brighter my eyes shine. I also love coding. Data science is where my two passions merge. 
  
- 🌱 I have just completed Turing College Data Science program (Machine learning).
  
- ⚡ My entire career I have been working with business finances - this is my key domain knowledge.
  
- 👯 I love making sense of data and communicating the discoveries to decision makers.
  
- 🤔 I’m looking for a junior data scientist, intermediate or senior data analyst role. 

- 😄 My hobbies:
  * Jogging
  * Coding
  * Reading
    
- 🛠 My tools:
  * Advanced Excel (Power Query) - 20 years / Power BI - 4 years
  * Python - hobby-studying since 2015. 2022-2023 was a rocket year in Turing College.
  * SQL
